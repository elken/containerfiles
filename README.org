As the title alludes to; this is a collection of Containerfiles for various
[[https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox][distrobox]] containers. Since I
typically use 1/2 main containers and spin up ones as I need them for various
reasons, I wanted to save me time having to input the same commands over and
over.

Inspired by [[https://github.com/travier/quay-containerfiles][travier's containerfiles]] repo, insofar as borrowing the structure.
